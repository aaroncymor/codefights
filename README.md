#Introduction
	This repository contains all solved daily challenges
	from code fights (https://codefights.com/challenges).

##Why
	I want to make it a habit to solve some challenges
	as much as I can everyday. I wanted to improve myself as a 
	developer. It's really difficult to solve most of them when
	you don't have a strong Computer Science / Mathematics background. 
	However, through these challenges, it will force me to research on
	Computer Science concepts in order to be able to atleast understand
	them even if I can't solve them.
